Faulty Calculator â€“ A JavaScript Calculator Thatâ€™s Rightâ€¦ Most of the Time!

This is a fun and experimental project built using JavaScript that simulates a calculatorâ€”but with a twist! 

It runs entirely in the browserâ€™s console and intentionally gives incorrect results 10% of the time to keep users guessing.

Itâ€™s a playful way to explore randomness, probability, and debugging in JavaScript while creating something unpredictable and entertaining.

ðŸ“Ÿ How to Run

Open this project in your browser.

Open the Developer Tools (usually by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I).

Go to the Console tab.

Call the calculator functions and see the resultsâ€”some of them will be wrong!

Features

âœ… Supports basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
âœ… Randomly introduces errors about 10% of the time
âœ… Runs entirely in the browserâ€™s consoleâ€”no UI needed
âœ… Great way to experiment with JavaScriptâ€™s random functions and debugging techniques

Why Build This?

âœ” Learn how randomness and probability can affect outcomes
âœ” Practice JavaScript fundamentals like functions, conditionals, and Math.random()
âœ” Explore how error-handling and testing work in real-world applications
âœ” Ideal for beginners to practice coding in the console environment
