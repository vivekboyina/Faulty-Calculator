Faulty Calculator – A JavaScript Calculator That’s Right… Most of the Time!

This is a fun, quirky project built using JavaScript that simulates a calculator—but with a twist! It intentionally gives incorrect results 10% of the time to keep users on their toes. It's a playful way to explore randomness, probability, and error-handling in JavaScript while creating something both useful and unpredictable.

Features

✅ Basic calculator functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
✅ Randomly introduces errors in calculations ~10% of the time
✅ Demonstrates how randomness and logic can be manipulated in JavaScript
✅ Great for learning about Math functions, event handling, and debugging

Why Build This?

✔ Explore JavaScript fundamentals in a fun, low-stakes project
✔ Experiment with probability and randomness
✔ Learn how users might react when tools aren’t always perfect
✔ Perfect for beginners who want to play with concepts like Math.random()
